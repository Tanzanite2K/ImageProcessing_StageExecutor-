# ImageProcessing_StageExecutor
This project is a comprehensive and interactive platform for applying core Digital Image Processing (DIP) techniques in a modular and user-controlled environment. Built using powerful libraries like OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Image, this system allows users to dynamically choose specific DIP stages—such as Image Acquisition, Color Processing, Compression, Enhancement, Morphological Operations, Segmentation, Restoration, Representation, and Recognition—and apply them directly to input images.

Each processing module is implemented as an individual Python script, ensuring clean separation of functionality and easy extensibility. The user-friendly interface guides users through a customized image transformation pipeline, displaying visual results at each stage for better understanding and analysis.

Whether you're a student exploring the depths of image processing or a developer building intelligent vision systems, this project serves as a hands-on toolkit to explore, experiment, and visualize the power of digital image processing in real-time.
